    abstract "The EuroMISE Center focuses on new approaches in the field of
 electronic health record (EHR). Among others, the structured health
 documentation in dentistry in the form of an EHR is being systematically
 studied. This paper describes the evolution of the EHR developed at the
 EuroMISE Center named MUDRLite and its graphical component for dentists
 called DentCross. The summary of features of the DentCross component is
 followed by a brief description of automatic speech recognition and an ASR
 module. The problems with data insertion into EHR during examination of a
 dental patient lead to further research in the area of the automatic speech
 recognition in medical practice. Cooperation of engineers, informaticians and
 dental physicians resulted in an application called DentVoice which is a
 successful application of the ASR module and the DentCross component of the
 MUDRLite EHR. The junction of voice control and graphical representation of
 dental arch makes hand-busy activities in dental praxis easier, quicker and
 more comfortable. This will result in a better quality of the data stored in
 a structured form in dental EHR, thus enabling better decision making and use
 of decision support systems.",
