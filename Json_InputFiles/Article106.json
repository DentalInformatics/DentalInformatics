    abstract "Implementation of clinical information systems is often
 difficult and costly. Little is known about how to implement electronic
 patient records in a complex dental school environment. The purpose of this
 study is to report how such a system was implemented at the University of
 Texas Health Science Center at Houston Dental Branch and to provide insights
 that may be useful for other institutions. To identify success factors and
 barriers, we reviewed project documents, interviewed key individuals on the
 implementation team, and surveyed end users before and after implementation.
 Eight critical issues were identified after extensive interviews with the
 project team. Surveys of students, faculty, and staff before and after
 implementation indicated that users had mixed feelings about the system in
 terms of efficiency and time required compared with paper charts. After using
 the system, many users felt that the electronic patient record improved
 patient care and that they would recommend such a system to dentists starting
 a new practice. By sharing lessons learned and knowledge about the science of
 implementation, we hope to reduce failures and costs for dental schools
 embarking on large-scale information technology implementations.",
