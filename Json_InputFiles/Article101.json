    abstract "Articulation of medical and dental practices has been strongly
 called for based on the many oral-systemic connections. With the rapid
 development and adoption of electronic health records, the feasibility of
 integrating medical and dental patient data should be strongly considered.
 The objective of this study was to develop an initial understanding of the
 medical providers' core dental information needs and opinion of integrated
 medical-dental electronic health record (iEHR) environment in their workflow.
 This was achieved by administering a 13 question survey to a group of 1,197
 medical care providers employed by Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin, United
 States. The survey received a response rate of 35%. The responses were
 analyzed based on provider 'Role' and 'Specialty'. The majority of the
 respondents felt the need for patient's dental information to coordinate or
 provide effective medical care. An integrated electronic health record
 environment could facilitate this holistic patient care approach.",
