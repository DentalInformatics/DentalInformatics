    abstract "Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems are rapidly gaining
 acceptance as an important tool for managing patient information. The purpose
 of this project was to evaluate the use of an EPR system for assessment of
 quality of care in an academic dental institution. The primary outcome of
 interest was the timeliness and completeness of restorative care following
 completion of nonsurgical root canal therapy. An initial query of the EPR
 database was performed using the following inclusion criteria: root canal
 treatment performed in the postgraduate endodontics clinic between September
 2002 and June 2004, patient age > or =18 years old, and posterior tooth
 (premolars and molars). A total of 925 patients with 1,014 endodontically
 treated teeth met the inclusion criteria. A random sample of 30 percent of
 the treated teeth (302 teeth on 281 patients) was selected for detailed
 review. This sample of 302 teeth was then screened to determine if any
 restorative treatment had been performed between September 2002 and November
 2005. Forty-eight percent (n=146) of the 302 teeth did not receive any form
 of permanent restoration over the time period studied. Twenty-five percent
 (n=75) of the teeth received a buildup only, and 27 percent (n=82) received
 the recommended treatment, a full occlusal coverage restoration. This study
 documents the use of an EPR system to objectively and efficiently assess one
 aspect of quality of care in a dental school environment.",
