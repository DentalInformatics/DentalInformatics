    abstract "Informed consents are routinely used as an important source of
 information to help patients make appropriate clinical decisions. However,
 current standard consent forms may not accomplish their intended purpose due
 to the variety of patient literacy and experiences and, in the dental school
 setting, the developing competence of students. The purpose of this pilot
 study was to test the efficacy of a personalized informed consent generated
 through an electronic health record (EHR) at one dental school and its role
 in patient decision making. In the study, a set of informed consents, or
 SmartConsents, were developed for specific diagnoses and procedures, enhanced
 with graphics, and delivered through the school's EHR. Fifty patients were
 recruited in the school's Urgent Care Clinic and divided evenly into two
 groups: one (control) receiving the standard consent, with the second
 receiving a SmartConsent. Following treatment, patients were assessed based
 on demographics, decisional conflict, satisfaction, health literacy, and
 knowledge. Overall, there were no significant differences in main effects
 between SmartConsent and standard informed consents for decisional conflict
 and satisfaction, although significant differences were identified during
 secondary analysis of satisfaction, gender, and ethnicity. The study also
 demonstrated the potential for consents to aid the student provider in better
 communicating with patients. ",
