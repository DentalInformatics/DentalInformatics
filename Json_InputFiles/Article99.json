    abstract "This study investigated current trends of Iowa dental
 practitioners with regard to acquisition and utilization of scientific
 information resources to support decision making in the clinical practice of
 dentistry. A survey questionnaire regarding the utilization of various
 sources of information to support clinical decisions was mailed in September
 2009 to all dentists licensed and practicing in the state of Iowa. Dentists
 appointed full-time within the University of Iowa College of Dentistry were
 excluded from this study. Continuing education courses were the most
 frequently utilized and preferred information source by respondents, followed
 by print journals and consultation with other health care professionals.
 Practice patterns according to decade of dental school graduation as well as
 scope of practice were noted. The results of this study demonstrate that
 dental practitioners utilize a variety of evidence-based and
 non-evidence-based information resources to support decisions in clinical
 practice. The habits of newer graduates vary somewhat from those of earlier
 graduates; the habits of specialists vary from those of general practitioners.",
