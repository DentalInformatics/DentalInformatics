    abstract "AIM: The goal of the Collaboration Spotting project is to create
 an automatic system to collect information about publications and patents
 related to a given technology, to identify the key players involved, and to
 highlight collaborations and related technologies. The collected information
 can be visualized in a web browser as interactive graphical maps showing in
 an intuitive way the players and their collaborations (Sociogram) and the
 relations among the technologies (Technogram). We propose to use the system
 to study technologies related to oral medicine. METHODS: In order to create a
 sociogram, we create a logical filter based on a set of keywords related to
 the technology under study. This filter is used to extract a list of
 publications from the Web of Science database. The list is validated by an
 expert in the technology and sent to CERN where it is inserted in the
 Collaboration Spotting database. Here, an automatic software system uses the
 data to generate the final maps. RESULTS: We studied a set of recent
 technologies related to bone regeneration procedures of oro-maxillo-facial
 critical size defects, namely the use of porous hydroxyapatite (HA) as a bone
 substitute alone (bone graft) or as a tridimensional support (scaffold) for
 insemination and differentiation ex vivo of mesenchymal stem cells. We
 produced the sociograms for these technologies and the resulting maps are now
 accessible on-line. CONCLUSION: The Collaboration Spotting system allows the
 automatic creation of interactive maps to show the current and historical
 state of research on a specific technology. These maps are an ideal tool both
 for researchers who want to assess the state-of-the-art in a given
 technology, and for research organizations who want to evaluate their
 contribution to the technological development in a given field. We
 demonstrated that the system can be used in oral medicine as is produced the
 maps for an initial set of technologies in this field. We now plan to enlarge
 the set of mapped technologies in order to make the Collaboration Spotting
 system a useful reference tool for oral medicine research.",
