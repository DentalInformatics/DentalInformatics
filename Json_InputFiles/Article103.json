    abstract "Advances in informatics, particularly the implementation of
 electronic health records (EHR), in dentistry have facilitated the exchange
 of information. The majority of dental schools in North America use the same
 EHR system, providing an unprecedented opportunity to integrate these data
 into a repository that can be used for oral health education and research. In
 2007, fourteen dental schools formed the Consortium for Oral Health-Related
 Informatics (COHRI). Since its inception, COHRI has established structural
 and operational processes, governance and bylaws, and a number of work groups
 organized in two divisions: one focused on research (data standardization,
 integration, and analysis), and one focused on education (performance
 evaluations, virtual standardized patients, and objective structured clinical
 examinations). To date, COHRI (which now includes twenty dental schools) has
 been successful in developing a data repository, pilot-testing data
 integration, and sharing EHR enhancements among the group. This consortium
 has collaborated on standardizing medical and dental histories, developing
 diagnostic terminology, and promoting the utilization of informatics in
 dental education. The consortium is in the process of assembling the largest
 oral health database ever created. This will be an invaluable resource for
 research and provide a foundation for evidence-based dentistry for years to
 come.",
