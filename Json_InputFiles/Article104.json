    abstract "The purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of
 the impact of Health Information Technology Systems (HITS) on dental school
 users when the systems are integrated into chair-side patient care. We used
 qualitative research methods, including interviews, focus groups, and
 observations, to capture the experiences of HITS users at a single
 institution. Users included administrators, clinical faculty members,
 predoctoral students, support staff, and residents. The data were analyzed
 using a grounded theory approach, and nine themes emerged: 1) HITS benefits
 were disproportionate among users; 2) communicating about the HITS was
 challenging; 3) users experienced a range of strong emotions; 4) the
 instructor persona diminished; 5) there were shifts in the school's power
 structure; 6) allocation of end-users' time shifted; 7) the training and
 support needs of end-users were significant; 8) perceived lack of HITS
 usability made documentation cumbersome for clinicians; and 9) clinicians'
 workflow was disrupted. HITS integration into patient care impacts the work
 of all system users, especially end-users. The themes highlight areas of
 potential concern for implementers and users in integrating a HITS into
 patient care.",
