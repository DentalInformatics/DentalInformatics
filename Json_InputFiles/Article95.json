    abstract "BACKGROUND: Optical caries detection has the potential to be
 incorporated in telehealth medicine for preventive dental screening. The
 objective of this study was to evaluate and compare visible and near infrared
 detection methods for identifying early non-cavitated ex vivo occlusal
 demineralization. METHODS: Six blinded examiners were used to compare the
 accuracy of the following three examinations in detecting occlusal
 demineralization: Midwest Caries ID (MID), visual photographic examination
 (CAM) and Cross Polarization Optical Coherence Tomography (CP-OCT). For each
 diagnostic method, two examiners assessed the extracted tooth samples 1-2
 weeks apart. Teeth were then sectioned and lesion depth was confirmed (n =
 42) by a blinded histological examination using a glycol based caries
 indicator dye. The sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Sp), Intraclass
 Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Area under the Receiver Operator Curve
 (AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: For detecting any demineralization versus
 sound pit and fissure enamel, the mean Sen/Sp found was 46.9/85.0 for MID,
 80.5/52.5 for CAM, and 83.4/45.0 for CP-OCT. For detecting non-cavitated
 demineralization that progressed into the dentin, the mean Sen/Sp found was
 17.3/88.0 for MID, 48.0/57.8 for CAM, and 44.2/72.7 for CP-OCT. AUC values
 were statistically significant (P < 0.05) in three out of four examiner
 assessments when MID and CP-OCT were used to detect any demineralization. AUC
 values were significant for a single CAM examination. When assessing deeper
 non-cavitated lesions, none of the assessment methods were able to yield AUC
 values that were significantly different than a random 'coin flip' test. When
 examining reliability, MID demonstrated the highest ICC score (0.83) and
 CP-OCT had the lowest (0.49). CONCLUSION: Although MID and CP-OCT were useful
 in detecting the presence of demineralization, examiners were not able to
 utilize these devices to adequately assess the depth of the demineralization.
 This study found that MID and CP-OCT did not have markedly superior
 diagnostic values from simple CAM assessment for use in teledentistry.",
