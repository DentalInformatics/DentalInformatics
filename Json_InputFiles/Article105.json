    abstract "Health Information Technology Systems (HITS) are becoming more
 widely integrated into patient care in the dental school setting. The purpose
 of this study was to evaluate the impact of a chairside HITS on users in the
 dental school setting. Qualitative techniques, including interviews, focus
 groups and observations, were used. Using grounded theory, we saw 9 themes
 emerge. One theme of particular interest was that ""training and support
 needs of end-users were significant."" This paper explores this theme in
 detail and discusses the implications.",
