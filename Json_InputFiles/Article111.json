    abstract "Dental Informatics (DI) is the application of computer and
 information science to improve dental practice, research, education, and
 program administration. As an emerging field, dental informatics faces many
 challenges and barriers to establishing itself as a full-fledged discipline;
 these include the small number of geographically dispersed DI researchers as
 well as the lack of DI professional societies and DI-specific journals.
 E-communities have the potential to overcome these obstacles by bringing
 researchers together at a resources hub and giving them the ability to share
 information, discuss topics, and find collaborators. In this paper, we
 discuss our assessment of the information needs of individuals interested in
 DI and discuss their expectations for an e-community so that we can design an
 optimal electronic infrastructure for the Dental Informatics Online Community
 (DIOC). The 256 survey respondents indicated they prefer electronic resources
 over traditional print material to satisfy their information needs. The most
 frequently expected benefits from participation in the DIOC were general
 information (85% of respondents), peer networking (31.1%), and identification
 of potential collaborators and/or research opportunities (23.2%). We are
 currently building the DIOC electronic infrastructure: a searchable
 publication archive and the learning center have been created, and the people
 directory is underway. Readers are encouraged to access the DIOC Website at
 www.dentalinformatics.com and initiate a discussion with the authors of this
 paper.",
