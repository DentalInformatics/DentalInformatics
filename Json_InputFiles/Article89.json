    abstract "Electronic healthcare documentation is the key element of
 electronic healthcare (eHealth). Electronic oral health record (EOHR)
 supporting oral medicine is discussed. To provide dentists with a methodology
 and instrument to create oral health documentation in more efficient way,
 support information exchange and integration in dental domain and to ease
 dental decision-making and forensic dentistry identification tasks.The
 proposed methodology is used to model lifelong EOHR based on a small specific
 ontology where the use of other classification systems and nomenclatures,
 e.g. SNODENT, is possible. EOHRwith Lifelong DentCross user interface was
 developed and it has been supporting dental care at the University Hospital
 in Prague-Motol. The user interface is working in four languages and
 controlled by voice or keyboard. Lifelong DentCross user interface is
 reflecting the way of the work in dentistry and the EOHR can provide both
 structured and free text information to oral medicine. ",
