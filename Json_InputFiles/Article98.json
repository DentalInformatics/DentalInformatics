    abstract "Today's practitioners of dentistry can be overwhelmed by the
 need to analyze, understand, prioritize, and implement the extraordinary
 amounts of knowledge and technical skill required to practice ideal
 dentistry. Continuing education is not just necessary; an increasingly
 informed patient population demands it. Among many technological
 advancements, computers have permeated the mainstream of restorative
 dentistry. The conventional systems of radiography and impressioning are the
 latest to face a digital counterpart. This case presentation demonstrates how
 cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) and a dedicated digital
 impressioning system can be used alongside conventional techniques to obtain
 excellent esthetic and functional results.",
