    abstract "Electronic health records (EHRs) are a major development in the
 practice of dentistry, and dental schools and dental curricula have
 benefitted from this technology. Patient data entry, storage, retrieval,
 transmission, and archiving have been streamlined, and the potential for
 teledentistry and improvement in epidemiological research is beginning to be
 realized. However, maintaining patient health information in an electronic
 form has also changed the environment in dental education, setting up
 potential ethical dilemmas for students and faculty members. The purpose of
 this article is to explore some of the ethical issues related to EHRs, the
 advantages and concerns related to the use of computers in the dental
 operatory, the impact of the EHR on the doctor-patient relationship, the
 introduction of web-based EHRs, the link between technology and ethics, and
 potential solutions for the management of ethical concerns related to EHRs in
 dental schools.",
