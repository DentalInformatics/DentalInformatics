    abstract "The Consortium for Oral Health Research and Informatics (COHRI)
 is leading the way in use of the Dental Diagnostic System (DDS) terminology
 in the axiUm electronic health record (EHR). This collaborative pilot study
 had two aims: 1) to investigate whether use of the DDS terms positively
 impacted predoctoral dental students' critical thinking skills measured by
 the Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT), and 2) to refine study protocols.
 The study design was a natural experiment with cross-sectional data
 collection using the HSRT for 15 classes (2013-17) of students at three
 dental schools. Characteristics of students who had been exposed to the DDS
 terms were compared with students who had not, and the differences were
 tested by t-tests or chi-square tests. Generalized linear models were used to
 evaluate the relationship between exposure and outcome on the overall
 critical thinking score. The results showed that exposure was significantly
 related to overall score (p=0.01), with not-exposed students having lower
 mean overall scores. This study thus demonstrated a positive impact of using
 the DDS terminology in an EHR on the critical thinking skills of predoctoral
 dental students in three COHRI schools as measured by their overall score on
 the HSRT. These preliminary findings support future research to further
 evaluate a proposed model of critical thinking in clinical dentistry. ",
