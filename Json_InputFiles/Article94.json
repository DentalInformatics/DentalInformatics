    abstract "A key question for healthcare is how to operationalize the
 vision of the Learning Healthcare System, in which electronic health record
 data become a continuous information source for quality assurance and
 research. This project presents an initial, ontology-based, method for
 secondary use of electronic dental record (EDR) data. We defined a set of
 dental clinical research questions; constructed the Oral Health and Disease
 Ontology (OHD); analyzed data from a commercial EDR database; and created a
 knowledge base, with the OHD used to represent clinical data about 4,500
 patients from a single dental practice. Currently, the OHD includes 213
 classes and reuses 1,658 classes from other ontologies. We have developed an
 initial set of SPARQL queries to allow extraction of data about patients,
 teeth, surfaces, restorations and findings. Further work will establish a
 complete, open and reproducible workflow for extracting and aggregating data
 from a variety of EDRs for research and quality assurance. ",
