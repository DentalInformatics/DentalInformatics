    abstract "Online learning communities are entering the realm of web-based
 learning as a means of reflective collaborative learning. The purpose of this
 article is to describe the formation of an online learning community using a
 community of inquiry (COI) conceptual framework. Operative clinical
 simulation dental students at the University of British Columbia in Canada
 have been involved in an online COI for the past five years. This descriptive
 article presents an overview of the experiences involved in developing this
 COI and provides a conceptual framework for an online COI.",
